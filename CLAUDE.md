# Codex Signum — Core Library

## For Claude Code (and any coding agent)

---

## ⚠️ Neo4j Connection — READ THIS FIRST

**The env var is `NEO4J_USER`, not `NEO4J_USERNAME`.** This has caused repeated failures across multiple sessions. The driver in `src/graph/client.ts` reads `NEO4J_USER`. If your script or .env uses `NEO4J_USERNAME`, add this fallback:

```typescript
if (process.env.NEO4J_USERNAME && !process.env.NEO4J_USER) {
  process.env.NEO4J_USER = process.env.NEO4J_USERNAME;
}
```

Required env vars: `NEO4J_URI`, `NEO4J_USER`, `NEO4J_PASSWORD`. The `.env` file lives at repo root; fallback: `../DND-Manager/.env`. See `docs/NEO4J_CONNECTION.md` for full details.

---

## ⛔ MANDATORY: Pipeline-First Execution

**ALL milestone work MUST be executed through the Architect or DevAgent pipeline.**

You are NOT PERMITTED to execute manual task lists as raw sequential instructions. If you receive a prompt structured as sequential tasks (Task 0, Task 1, Task 2...), you MUST:

1. **STOP.** Do not execute the tasks directly.
2. **Extract the intent** from the prompt.
3. **Invoke the pipeline:**
   - Analytical/documentation work: `npx tsx scripts/architect.ts plan "<intent>" [flags]`
   - Coding tasks: `npx tsx scripts/dev-agent.ts run "<task>" --files=<paths> [flags]`
4. **Let the pipeline run** through its stages. Do not short-circuit, skip stages, or "help" by doing work outside the pipeline.

**Only exceptions — must be explicitly tagged in the prompt:**

| Tag | Meaning | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `[PIPELINE-PREP]` | Modifying the pipeline itself, or wiring prerequisites the pipeline needs before it can run | Updating CLAUDE.md governance, wiring `graphEnabled`, extending verify-graph-state.ts |
| `[NO-PIPELINE]` | Pure mechanical work with no analytical component | File renames, config edits, formatting fixes |

**If the pipeline fails, fix the pipeline. Do not do the work manually.**

**Why this rule exists:** The Architect and DevAgent pipelines write structural records to Neo4j (PipelineRun, TaskOutput, Decision, Observation nodes). Thompson posteriors update from outcomes. The system learns from its own execution. When work bypasses the pipeline, the system is blind to what happened — no structural representation, no learning, no quality assessment. Every manual bypass makes the system’s thesis (“state is structural”) false for that piece of work.

**This is not a guideline. It is a structural enforcement rule. Violation is the single most damaging anti-pattern for this repo.**

---

## ⛔ MANDATORY: Graph-Native Data Creation

All data written to Neo4j MUST follow Codex morpheme semantics. The graph is not a database — it is the structural encoding of system state. Every node, every relationship, every property must be legible, connected, and faithful to what it represents.

### The Five Rules

**Rule 1: Seed first, then evolve.**
Every piece of data enters the graph as a Seed. A Seed is "an atomic unit, datum, coherent unit" (v5.0 spec). It MUST have:

- `id` — unique identifier
- `seedType` — what kind of datum this is (e.g. "exit-criterion", "backlog", "test", "pipeline-output")
- `content` — the actual data. A Seed with only an id and name is a bare stub, not a datum. Bare stubs violate A1 (Fidelity).
- `status` — current state
- `createdAt` — provenance timestamp (A4)

Seeds evolve by gaining relationships (Lines), being contained by Blooms, accumulating Observations, or being transformed by Resonators. They are never created in isolation with the expectation that "we'll fill it in later."

**Rule 2: No node without a relationship.**
A node with zero relationships is structurally invisible. Per the spec: "A Seed with no inbound or outbound Lines is Dormant — present but not participating in any flow." Dormant Seeds are acceptable ONLY when they genuinely represent latent capability awaiting connection. A backlog item that has a known target milestone is NOT dormant — it should have a SCOPED_TO relationship.

Every node creation MUST be accompanied by at least one relationship creation in the same transaction:

- Seed → CONTAINS from parent Bloom
- Seed → SCOPED_TO target Bloom (if applicable)
- Bloom → CONTAINS from parent Bloom (G3 containment)
- Bloom → DEPENDS_ON prerequisite Bloom (if dependency exists)

**Rule 3: Containment is parent → child. Always.**
G3 (Containment): "A Bloom enclosing other morphemes defines scope." The parent declares what it contains.

- `(parent)-[:CONTAINS]->(child)` ✅
- `(child)-[:PART_OF]->(parent)` ❌ NEVER
- `(child)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(parent)` ❌ NEVER

No exceptions. No "it's the same thing in reverse." Direction encodes semantics (G2). Parent → child is scope declaration. Child → parent is a different semantic (provenance, attribution) that uses different relationship types.

**Rule 4: Blooms define scope through what they CONTAIN, not through properties.**
A Bloom's scope is the set of morphemes it contains. A Bloom with `scope: "do X, Y, Z"` as a string property but no child Seeds for X, Y, Z is not a scope boundary — it's a label with a description. The graph structure must be self-describing:

- Milestone exit criteria → Seed nodes CONTAINED by the milestone Bloom
- Milestone sub-tasks → Bloom nodes CONTAINED by the milestone Bloom
- Milestone dependencies → DEPENDS_ON Lines between Blooms

If you need to know "what does this milestone require?", the answer is a CONTAINS traversal, not a property read.

**Rule 5: State dimensions derive from structure, not manual assignment.**

- `phiL` on a parent Bloom derives from its children (complete ratio), not from a hardcoded value
- `status` on a parent Bloom derives from its children (all-complete/some-complete/none), not from manual SET
- The only exception is leaf nodes (Seeds, terminal Blooms with no children) where status is set directly by the stamp operation

### Milestone Bloom Stamp Protocol

Every sub-milestone stamp is THREE operations, not one. Missing any step breaks the structural hierarchy.

Step 1 — Stamp the sub-milestone:

```cypher
MERGE (b:Bloom {id: $subMilestoneId})
SET b.status = 'complete', b.phiL = 0.9,
    b.commitSha = $commitSha, b.testCount = $testCount,
    b.completedAt = datetime()
```

Step 2 — Wire to parent (MANDATORY — without this edge the sub-milestone is structurally invisible):

```cypher
MATCH (parent:Bloom {id: $parentId}), (b:Bloom {id: $subMilestoneId})
MERGE (parent)-[:CONTAINS]->(b)
```

Step 3 — Recalculate parent status from children:

```cypher
MATCH (child:Bloom)<-[:CONTAINS]-(parent:Bloom {id: $parentId})
WITH parent,
     count(child) AS total,
     count(CASE WHEN child.status = 'complete' THEN 1 END) AS done
SET parent.status = CASE
      WHEN done = total THEN 'complete'
      WHEN done > 0 THEN 'active'
      ELSE 'planned' END,
    parent.phiL = CASE
      WHEN done = total THEN 0.9
      WHEN done > 0 THEN 0.5
      ELSE 0.3 END,
    parent.updatedAt = datetime()
```

Gate rule: Bloom stamps require Ro's in-session review before execution.

### Backlog Seed Creation Protocol

Every backlog refinement (R-N) enters the graph as:

```cypher
MERGE (s:Seed {id: $id})
SET s.seedType = "backlog",
    s.name = $name,
    s.content = $description,    // MANDATORY — what this item actually is
    s.status = $status,
    s.target = $targetMilestone,
    s.createdAt = datetime()

// Wire to target milestone if one exists
WITH s
MATCH (m:Bloom {id: $targetMilestone})
MERGE (s)-[:SCOPED_TO]->(m)
```

### Exit Criteria Seed Creation Protocol

Every exit criterion for a milestone enters the graph as:

```cypher
MERGE (s:Seed {id: $milestoneId + ':ec-' + $number})
SET s.seedType = "exit-criterion",
    s.content = $criterionText,    // MANDATORY — what must be true for completion
    s.status = $status,
    s.createdAt = datetime()

// Wire to parent milestone
WITH s
MATCH (m:Bloom {id: $milestoneId})
MERGE (m)-[:CONTAINS]->(s)
```

### DEPENDS_ON Direction Convention

Dependency edges follow forward flow: `(prerequisite)-[:DEPENDS_ON]->(dependent)`.

"M-9 DEPENDS_ON M-9.V" means M-9 must complete before M-9.V can begin. The critical path reads top-to-bottom as prerequisite → dependent.

This is the core library for the Codex Signum protocol — a semantic encoding where **state is structural**. Consumer applications (like DND-Manager) import from this package. This repo is the single source of truth for all grammar-level infrastructure.

### Constitutional Bloom

The Constitutional Bloom is the organisational core of the graph. It contains the 41 definition Seeds (axioms A1–A4, A6–A9; grammar rules G1–G5; morpheme definitions) and governance Resonators that enforce structural invariants. All other Blooms derive their compliance context from Constitutional CONTAINS edges. Bootstrapped via `scripts/bootstrap-constitutional-bloom.ts`.

### Dispatch Routing

DISPATCH routes tasks based on CLASSIFY output. Classification is layered:

| Layer | Signal | What It Detects |
|-------|--------|----------------|
| 1. Content-shape | `input_type` + `output_type` from DECOMPOSE | Structured data transforms, code-to-code transforms |
| 2. File-type | `files_affected` extensions + operation keywords | Structured data files with transform ops, source code with rename/move ops |
| 3. Keyword | Title + description keyword matching | Generative vs mechanical based on action verbs |

Routing table:

| Task Type | Confidence | Execution Path |
|-----------|-----------|----------------|
| deterministic | any (with registered executor) | DeterministicExecutor — no LLM, script execution |
| deterministic | any (no executor) | Falls back to generative LLM |
| mechanical | ≥ 0.6 | DevAgent: SCOPE → EXECUTE → REVIEW → VALIDATE |
| mechanical | < 0.6 | LLM (single call — uncertain classification) |
| generative | any | LLM (single call via Thompson) |

All paths record outcomes. Thompson learns from generative and mechanical paths. Deterministic paths record TaskOutcome for audit but don't update Thompson posteriors (no model selection involved).

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. This is a LIBRARY, not an application

Core is substrate-agnostic. It does NOT know about:
- DND-Manager, D&D, character sheets
- Specific LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, Google)
- Specific databases beyond abstract graph interfaces
- Any consumer application's business logic

If you find yourself importing from a consumer app — **STOP. You are going the wrong direction.**

The `scripts/` directory is an exception: it provides self-hosting tooling for running the Architect pattern on core itself. These scripts use raw `fetch()` for LLM calls and read API keys from environment variables — they demonstrate the pattern without pulling in provider SDKs. Scripts are NOT part of the library's public API.

### 2. dist/ is committed. There is NO prepare script.

```bash
npm run build       # Compiles to dist/
git add dist/       # ALWAYS commit dist/ after building
git commit          # Consumers install from GitHub and use committed dist/
```

**DO NOT** add a `prepare` script to package.json. npm runs `prepare` automatically when a consumer installs a GitHub dependency, which would rebuild dist/ from source during install and overwrite the committed files. This bug cost hours to diagnose. See commit `4cd0ecc`.

### 3. State Is Structural — No Monitoring Overlays

The graph is the single source of truth. Do NOT create:
- Separate health databases or JSON caches
- SQLite tables for monitoring data
- Log files as state stores
- Any parallel state outside the graph

**DO NOT PROPOSE** any of the following — these are recurring LLM paradigm violations that directly contradict "state is structural":
- Observation pipelines or monitoring overlays (Prometheus, Grafana, DataDog patterns)
- Dashboard wrapper functions that read from the graph and present via a separate layer
- Computed views or aggregation functions that sit between the graph and consumers
- "codexStats" grammar sections or health snapshot utilities
- Any system where you query the graph, transform the result, and store/present it separately

The graph IS the monitoring infrastructure. Observations flow through execution, not through a separate instrumentation layer. If you need to know system state, write a Cypher query. If the Cypher query is complex, it's still a Cypher query — not a wrapper function.

### 4. ΦL Is ALWAYS a Composite

ΦL is never `health: number`. It is always a structured object with raw factors, weights, maturity_factor, and effective score. If you see a bare number being passed as health, it's wrong.

### 5. Dampening Is NEVER Fixed

`γ = 0.7` everywhere is WRONG. Always compute from topology:
```
γ_effective = min(0.7, 0.8 / k)    # budget-capped, guarantees μ = k×γ ≤ 0.8 < 1
```
Hub dampening uses `γ_base / √k` (NOT `γ_base / degree`).

### 6. Hysteresis = 2.5×

Recovery is 2.5× slower than degradation. Not 1.5×. This was corrected by research validation.

### 7. Cascade Limit = 2

Degradation propagates at most 2 containment levels. This is the primary safety mechanism. Never increase without a foundational amendment.

### 8. Signal Pipeline Is Complete — Don't Modify

The 7-stage signal conditioning pipeline in `src/computation/signals/` was built across 15 carefully audited commits, verified against Engineering Bridge §Part 4. Do not modify it unless fixing a specific documented bug.

### 9. .js Extensions on ALL Relative Imports

Every relative import MUST use `.js` extension:
```typescript
// CORRECT
import { computePhiL } from "./phi-l.js";

// WRONG — will fail at runtime
import { computePhiL } from "./phi-l";
```

### 10. Commit + Push After Every Task

Every discrete task produces a commit with a descriptive message and pushes to remote. Never accumulate uncommitted work across tasks.

### 11. Substrate-Agnostic Logic Belongs in Core

If a function uses only core types (`TaskGraph`, `PipelineSurveyOutput`, `ModelExecutor`, etc.) and any consumer would benefit from it, it belongs here — not in a consumer repo. The test: does the function import anything from outside `@codex-signum/core`? If no, it's core infrastructure.

This rule exists because the most expensive architectural mistake in the project's history was placing `parallelDecompose()` and `scorePlan()` in DND-Manager instead of core. The correction required a two-repo, two-session refactor. When in doubt, put it in core.

Conversely, if a function constructs provider-specific clients (Thompson router instances, native SDK wrappers), checks consumer-specific state (git remotes, working directories), or uses consumer-specific types — it stays in the consumer.

### 12. Docs Corpus Is SURVEY's Source of Truth

The `docs/` directory is not documentation for humans — it is the **specification corpus that SURVEY reads**. Files in `docs/specs/`, `docs/research/`, and `docs/hypotheses/` are consumed programmatically by `discoverDocumentSources()` and `parseHypotheses()` in the SURVEY stage.

Do NOT:
- Remove or rename files without updating SURVEY's discovery paths
- Add non-specification files to `docs/specs/` (use `docs/` root for prompts and operational docs)
- Create hypotheses without the `## H-{NNN}:` heading format (SURVEY parser depends on it)
- Mix short-named and long-named copies in the same directory (use short names in `docs/research/`)

When adding new research papers: create a short-named copy (e.g., `new-topic.md`) in `docs/research/`. When adding new hypotheses: follow the format in `docs/hypotheses/README.md` — each must have Source, Claim, Status, Evidence fields.

---

## Self-Hosting CLI

Core runs the Architect pattern on itself via scripts in `scripts/`. These are NOT part of the library — they are consumer-grade tooling that demonstrates self-hosting.

**Pipeline Status: OPERATIONAL.** The full 7-stage pipeline (SURVEY → DECOMPOSE → CLASSIFY → SEQUENCE → GATE → DISPATCH → ADAPT) is validated and live. Thompson sampling routes model selection at DECOMPOSE and DISPATCH. The pipeline has been validated with both simple (1-task) and complex (19-task) intents. Analytical work on this repo MUST go through the pipeline — not be performed manually by an agent.

### Running the Architect

```bash
# Full pipeline: survey + decompose + classify + sequence + gate + dispatch + adapt
# This is the canonical way to run analytical work on this repo.
npx tsx scripts/architect.ts plan "<intent>"

# With options
npx tsx scripts/architect.ts plan "<intent>" --auto-gate --dry-run --decompose-n=3
```

### Running Reconciliation (No LLM)

```bash
# Pure filesystem + graph analysis — outputs gap report, claims, hypotheses, confidence score
npx tsx scripts/reconcile.ts
```

### Seeding Agents

```bash
# Requires running Neo4j instance
npx tsx scripts/seed-agents.ts
```

### Bootstrap Architecture

The self-hosting CLI uses a **bootstrap executor** (`scripts/bootstrap-executor.ts`) that implements core's `ModelExecutor` interface via raw `fetch()` calls. It reads `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` from environment (plus Vertex AI via `gcloud auth application-default login`) and calls core's `selectModel()` for Thompson-routed selection.

The **task executor** (`scripts/bootstrap-task-executor.ts`) is V1 safe-default: it generates task prompts but does NOT auto-apply filesystem changes. Key capabilities (M-8C):

- **File context injection**: `files_affected` injected as read context (32K cap analytical, 8K mechanical, 120K total budget)
- **Cross-task output injection**: synthesis/consolidation tasks receive prior task outputs as context (6K cap each)
- **Post-dispatch consistency check**: scans all outputs for metric divergence, wrong axiom/stage names
- **Hallucination detection (Jidoka)**: 3-layer andon cord (signal/content/structural) flags fabrications before write
- **Pre-flight auth gate**: `verifyProviderAuth()` refuses degraded infrastructure (overridable with `--allow-degraded`)

Pre-flight checks verify: correct git remote (Codex_signum, not DND-Manager), clean working tree, passing type check, provider authentication.

### Human Feedback (breaks LLM-evaluating-LLM circularity)

```bash
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts accept <runId>           # Human approves run
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts reject <runId> "reason"   # Human rejects run
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts partial <runId> --accept=t1 --reject=t2 "reason"
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts calibrate                  # Show precision/recall
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts pending                    # Runs awaiting feedback
npx tsx scripts/feedback.ts status <runId>             # Check feedback for a run
```

Thompson reads `adjustedQuality` (human-calibrated) when available, falls back to `qualityScore` (LLM-only). Over time, this creates a calibration signal that corrects systematic LLM scoring biases. Reject verdict applies a 0.5× quality penalty to Decision nodes from the run.

### Running the DevAgent (Coding Tasks)

```bash
# Mechanical coding task through SCOPE → EXECUTE → REVIEW → VALIDATE
npx tsx scripts/dev-agent.ts run "<task description>" --files=<paths> --complexity=<level>

# With options
npx tsx scripts/dev-agent.ts run "Rename AgentProps to SeedProps" \
  --files=src/graph/queries.ts --complexity=moderate --preset=full --milestone=M-7C
```

DevAgent uses Thompson routing per stage. Quality assessment is V1 mechanical (pattern-matching). Human feedback via `feedback.ts` provides calibration. DevAgent does NOT auto-apply changes — it produces quality-gated output for human review.

**When to use which pipeline:**

- **Architect** (`scripts/architect.ts`): Analytical work — spec reviews, audits, multi-file analysis
- **DevAgent** (`scripts/dev-agent.ts`): Coding tasks — renames, refactors, feature implementation

---

## SURVEY Broadening — Document Discovery & Claim Extraction

SURVEY now auto-discovers the documentation corpus and cross-references it against implementation:

**Document Discovery** (`discoverDocumentSources()`):
- Recursively finds `.md` files in configured `docsPaths` (default: `docs/specs/`, `docs/research/`)
- Reads content (8000 char cap), extracts title
- Runs `extractClaims()` to identify formula, threshold, warning, recommendation, and architectural claims
- Notes `.pdf` files as blind spots

**Claim Extraction** (`extractClaims()`):
Pattern-based (no LLM required). Detects:
- **Formulas**: Greek letters (γ, ε, Φ, Ψ), math operators, `min()`, `max()`, `clamp()`
- **Thresholds**: "must be < N", "limit of N", "budget of 0.8"
- **Warnings**: "supercritical", "dangerously inadequate", "CRITICAL"
- **Recommendations**: "recommended fix", "should use", "replace with"
- **Architectural**: "state is structural", "must not", "constitutional", "axiom"

**Research-Divergence Gaps**: When a document claims a formula/threshold that differs from what the codebase implements, SURVEY generates a `research-divergence` gap. When a warning/recommendation targets a pattern that still exists, it becomes a gap.

**Hypothesis Tracking** (`parseHypotheses()`):
- Reads `docs/hypotheses/*.md` files
- Parses `## H-{NNN}:` blocks with Source, Claim, Status, Evidence fields
- Hypotheses with status "proposed" + corresponding code → flagged as "ready for validation"
- Untested hypotheses reduce confidence score

---

## Architect Pattern — executePlan() Configuration

The `executePlan()` orchestrator accepts an `ArchitectConfig` with these options:

```typescript
interface ArchitectConfig {
  modelExecutor: ModelExecutor;     // Consumer provides: how to call LLMs
  taskExecutor: TaskExecutor;       // Consumer provides: how to execute tasks
  autoGate?: boolean;               // Skip human approval (default: false)
  decomposeAttempts?: number;       // Best-of-N decompose attempts (default: 1)
  parallelDecompose?: boolean;      // Run attempts concurrently (default: false)
  dryRun?: boolean;                 // Tasks execute but make no real changes (default: false)
}
```

When `decomposeAttempts > 1`, core runs decompose N times, scores each plan on confidence, task count reasonableness, gap coverage, and internal consistency, then selects the best. Research basis: Best-of-N gives log(N) quality improvement; Self-MoA shows same strong model N times outperforms mixing different models.

Consumers call `executePlan(intent, repoPath, config, surveyOutput?)` — core owns the full orchestration loop (SURVEY → DECOMPOSE → CLASSIFY → SEQUENCE → GATE → DISPATCH → ADAPT). Consumers should **never re-implement the stage sequence** — inject behavior through executors and config, not by calling individual stages.

## Files That DO NOT EXIST — Never Reference These

- ~~`src/health/`~~ → Health computation is in `src/computation/`
- ~~`src/agent/`~~ → There is no agent directory, patterns are in `src/patterns/`
- ~~`src/config/`~~ → No config directory
- ~~`src/utils/firebase.ts`~~ → Firebase does not exist in this project
- ~~`src/monitoring/`~~ → Monitoring is structural, not separate
- ~~`src/services/`~~ → No services directory
- ~~`core/` at repo root~~ → Source is in `src/`, not `core/`

If you need to find where something lives:
```bash
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | sort
grep -rn "export.*functionName" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

## Build & Verification

```bash
# One-time setup: activate checked-in git hooks for any editor/agent
git config core.hooksPath .githooks

# Type check (run after every edit)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
npm test

# Build (ALWAYS do before committing)
npm run build

# Commit dist (ALWAYS after build)
git add dist/
git commit -m "build: description"

node -e "const c = require('./dist'); console.log(Object.keys(c).length, 'exports')"

# Run reconciliation report (no LLM, pure analysis)
npx tsx scripts/reconcile.ts
```

---

## What NOT to Change

- **Morphemes, axioms, grammar rules** — these are immutable (v5.0 §Semantic Stability)
- **Signal conditioning pipeline** — 15 audited commits, verified against spec
- **Graph schema** — stable, extend only if adding new node types
- **Existing test expectations** — unless a fix changes behavior to match spec
- **package.json `prepare` script** — DO NOT ADD ONE (see rule #2)
- **Hypothesis IDs** — H-{NNN} numbers are permanent identifiers; supersede don't renumber

---

## Test Governance

### Test Levels

| Level | Name | Scope | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Unit | Single function, deterministic, pure computation | `tests/conformance/` |
| 2 | Contract | Module API shape, type safety, export completeness | `tests/conformance/` |
| 3 | Pipeline | Multi-stage sequential flow, data propagation | `tests/pipeline/` |
| 4 | Outcome | End-to-end behavioral correctness with realistic inputs | `tests/conformance/` |
| 5 | Safety | Invariants that must never be violated, spec-encoded | `tests/safety/` |

Level 5 tests encode what the **spec requires**, not what the code currently does. If the implementation is wrong, safety tests FAIL — this is correct behavior. Tests-before-fix is the right order.

### Safety Invariants (Level 5)

| Invariant | Test File | Spec Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subcriticality: γ_effective ≤ 0.7 for all degree ≥ 1 | `tests/safety/subcriticality.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Cascade limit: propagation stops at depth 2 | `tests/safety/cascade-limit.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Hysteresis: recovery rate = degradation rate / 2.5 | `tests/safety/hysteresis.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Algedonic bypass: ΦL < 0.1 forces γ = 1.0 | `tests/safety/algedonic-bypass.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |

### Codex Conformance Coverage

Conformance tests (`tests/conformance/`) must cover these Codex dimensions:

- **State dimensions**: ΦL composite structure (never bare number), ΨH relational computation, εR spectral calibration
- **Morphemes**: Seed, Line, Bloom, Resonator, Grid, Helix — type shape and axiom compliance
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Young/Maturing/Mature bands with smooth interpolation
- **Signal pipeline**: All 7 stages spec-compliant (Debounce → Hampel → EWMA → CUSUM → MACD → Hysteresis → Trend)
- **Memory operations**: Exponential decay compaction (not fixed window), distillation, flow
- **Constitutional engine**: Rule evaluation, cascade prevention, amendment taxonomy
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker with exponential backoff + jitter (not fixed cooldown)
- **Patterns**: Architect 7-stage pipeline, dev-agent pipeline, Thompson router
- **SURVEY broadening**: Document discovery, claim extraction, hypothesis parsing, research-divergence gap detection

### Data Provenance Rule

All numbers cited in documentation, comments, code, or reports MUST:

- Cite their source (spec section, test output, or system measurement)
- Be marked `[estimated]` if produced by approximation rather than system output
- Never be presented as system output if they were estimated by inspection

### Regression Baselines

These are the current baselines. Test counts must only go up. Export counts may change with legitimate additions.

| Metric | Baseline | Source |
|---|---|---|
| Tests passing | 1570 | `npm test` at HEAD |
| Barrel exports | 279 | `node -e "const c = require('./dist'); console.log(Object.keys(c).length)"` |

### Pipeline Test Coverage Gate

The pre-commit gate warns (not blocks) if `src/signals/` was modified but `tests/pipeline/` has no `*.test.ts` files.

---

## Anti-Patterns (v5.0 Taxonomy)

The v5.0 spec defines 10 canonical anti-patterns. All graph-writing agents must avoid these:

1. **Monitoring Overlay** — separate observation/dashboard layer outside the graph
2. **Intermediary Layer** — wrapper functions between graph and consumers
3. **Dimensional Collapse** — reducing composite state dimensions to bare scalars
4. **Prescribed Behaviour** — one pattern imperatively controlling another
5. **Governance Theatre** — rules that exist on paper but aren't structurally enforced
6. **Shadow Operations** — work that bypasses the pipeline (manual analysis bypass)
7. **Defensive Filtering** — suppressing signals to avoid triggering thresholds
8. **Skilled Incompetence** — technically correct actions that undermine system learning
9. **Undiscussable Accumulation** — known issues left unaddressed until crisis
10. **Pathological Autopoiesis** — system optimising for self-preservation over purpose

### Incidents This Repo Has Encountered

These are real bugs that have occurred in past sessions. Hooks exist to catch them.

| Anti-Pattern | What Went Wrong | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed dampening γ=0.7 | Supercritical for branching factor ≥ 2 | Always compute γ_effective from topology |
| Fixed circuit breaker cooldown | Spec requires exponential backoff + jitter | Use `computeCooldown(tripCount, config)` |
| ModelExecutor name collision | Both dev-agent and architect exported same name | dev-agent uses `DevAgentModelExecutor` |
| `prepare` script in package.json | Rebuilt dist/ during consumer `npm install` | Removed in `4cd0ecc`, never re-add |
| Averaging children's ΨH | ΨH is relational — compute from subgraph λ₂ | `aggregateHealth` computes ΨH from graph |
| Static retention window for compaction | Spec uses continuous exponential decay | `weight = e^(-λ × age)`, not fixed window |
| Hysteresis ratio 1.5× | Below Schmitt trigger engineering standards | Corrected to 2.5× per research validation |
| Bare `number` as health score | ΦL must always be composite structure | Use `PhiLOutput` type, never bare number |
| Consumer re-implements core orchestration | DND called classify/sequence/gate/dispatch/adapt individually instead of `executePlan()` | Consumers call `executePlan()` with config — inject behavior through executors, not by re-implementing the stage loop |
| Substrate-agnostic logic in consumer | `parallelDecompose()` and `scorePlan()` placed in DND instead of core | If it uses only core types and any consumer benefits → it belongs in core (Rule 11) |
| Observation pipelines / monitoring overlays (e.g., Observer pattern) | State is structural — graph-feeder writes observations inline | `conditionValue()` and `computePhiL()` are pure functions called during writes, not routed through intermediaries. Do NOT create collector.ts, evaluator.ts, or auditor.ts. Observer class was deleted in `ce0ef96`; feedback functions + GraphObserver interface retained. |
| Case-sensitive directory names across platforms | `docs/Research/` vs `docs/research/` — agent on Linux created both | Standardize on lowercase `docs/research/`. Known issue pending cleanup. |
| **⛔ Manual analysis bypass** | **MOST CRITICAL ANTI-PATTERN.** Agent executes sequential task lists directly instead of invoking `scripts/architect.ts plan` or `scripts/dev-agent.ts run`. Every bypass means no PipelineRun, no TaskOutput, no Decision nodes, no Thompson learning — the system is blind to what happened. If you find yourself executing “Task 0... Task 1... Task 2...” from a prompt, STOP and invoke the pipeline instead. | Pipeline-First Execution rule (top of this document). If the pipeline fails, fix it — don’t work around it. |
| Dimensional Collapse (hallucinated facts) | LLM outputs fabricate axiom names, wrong counts (e.g. "10 axioms", "5-stage pipeline"), reference eliminated entities (Observer pattern, Model Sentinel, Symbiosis) | `detectHallucinations()` in bootstrap-task-executor flags signal/content/structural issues. Canonical constants: 8 axioms (v5.0), 7 stages, `ELIMINATED_ENTITIES` list. Consistency check runs post-dispatch. |
| **Orphaned sub-milestone** | `MERGE (b:Bloom {id: 'M-9.5'}) SET b.status = 'complete'` with no CONTAINS edge to parent | Sub-milestone is structurally invisible. No CONTAINS edge = doesn't exist in the hierarchy. The edge IS the containment, not the naming convention. |
| **Bare stub Seed** | `MERGE (s:Seed {id: 'R-33'}) SET s.name = 'Typed containment'` with no content, no relationships | A1 Fidelity: representation doesn't match what the item actually is. A Seed is "an atomic datum" — data has content. Every Seed must have content and at least one relationship. |
| **Manual parent status** | `SET parent.status = 'complete', parent.phiL = 0.9` without checking children | A1 Fidelity: status must derive from structure. Parent status = f(children), not a manual assignment. Use the three-step stamp protocol. |
| **Reverse containment** | `(child)-[:PART_OF]->(parent)` or `(child)-[:BELONGS_TO]->(parent)` | G3 violation. Containment is parent → child. The encloser declares its scope. Always CONTAINS, always parent → child. |
| **Compliance-as-Monitoring** | Tests that scan the graph for data quality violations after creation. Conformance test suites. Validation scripts that check "does every Seed have content?" as a monitoring pass. | A2/A3 violation: state is structural — compliance should be a property of the creation path, not a separate verification layer. R-39 fixed this: `DataSeedProps` requires content at the type level, `createDataSeed()` throws on empty content, Neo4j constraints reject null. Enforcement is structural. |
| **NEO4J_USERNAME vs NEO4J_USER** | Scripts fail auth using wrong env var name | Always use `NEO4J_USER`. Add fallback. See `docs/NEO4J_CONNECTION.md`. |
| **Source-only sweep** | Anti-pattern sweep scoped from GitHub source code only, without querying Neo4j to discover what actually exists in the graph. Source shows what code *would create*; only the graph shows what *was created* across months of execution. 109 legacy Pattern nodes accumulated undetected because the sweep never asked Neo4j what labels existed. | Any sweep or audit that touches graph state MUST start with Neo4j diagnostic queries. Discover what exists first, cross-reference against source second. See §Graph-First Sweep Methodology below. |

### Graph-First Sweep Methodology

Any task that involves cleaning up, auditing, or sweeping graph state MUST follow this order:

1. **Query Neo4j first** — run diagnostic Cypher to discover all labels, counts, orphans, stale entities, missing relationships, constraint violations
2. **Cross-reference against source** — compare what exists in the graph against what the source code creates
3. **Fix source** — remove or correct anything in source that would recreate the problem
4. **Fix graph** — clean up everything the diagnostic scan found
5. **Verify** — re-run the diagnostic scan to confirm zero violations

**Never scope a sweep from source code alone.** Source code shows what a bootstrap script *would create* on the next run. The graph shows what *was created* across every previous run — including runs from months ago with different code. Bootstrap scripts run repeatedly; stale nodes accumulate silently.

This rule exists because scoping an anti-pattern sweep from GitHub missed 109 legacy `:Pattern` nodes that had accumulated from months of `bootstrapPatterns()` executions. The source code had moved on to creating `:Bloom` nodes, but the graph still contained the old `:Pattern` nodes from every prior run.

---

## Pipeline Execution Protocol

When running the Architect pipeline or any long-running LLM-backed process, use asynchronous supervision — never block synchronously waiting for completion.

### Launch with Output Capture

Always pipe pipeline output to both console and a log file:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/architect.ts plan "<intent>" [flags] 2>&1 | tee /tmp/architect-run.log
```

Run in the background so you can monitor progress and report to the user at each stage. The log file is your diagnostic tool if a stage fails or stalls.

### Progress Reporting

Report to the user at each stage transition. Include key metrics:

| Stage | What to Report |
|---|---|
| SURVEY | Doc count, hypothesis count, gap count, confidence %, blind spots |
| DECOMPOSE | Model selected (Thompson), task count, phase count, LLM call duration, thinking duration if applicable |
| CLASSIFY | Mechanical vs generative breakdown |
| SEQUENCE | Critical path length, parallelism opportunities |
| GATE | Full plan structure — task titles, dependencies, estimated complexity |
| DISPATCH | Per-task: model selected, pass/fail, output summary, duration, thinking duration if applicable |
| ADAPT | Failure count, adaptation strategy, retry decisions |

Do NOT wait until the entire pipeline completes to report. Each stage completion is a progress checkpoint.

### Stall Detection (Streaming-Based)

The bootstrap executor uses streaming API calls. During extended thinking, heartbeat logs appear every 15 seconds:

```text
  [claude-opus-4-6] thinking started...
  [claude-opus-4-6] still thinking... 15s elapsed
  [claude-opus-4-6] still thinking... 30s elapsed
  [claude-opus-4-6] still thinking... 45s elapsed
  [claude-opus-4-6] thinking complete (52.3s)
```

**If heartbeats are arriving:** The model is alive and working. Do NOT interrupt. Extended thinking models (Opus, Sonnet 4.6) can legitimately think for 5+ minutes on complex intents like multi-task decomposition.

**If heartbeats stop arriving AND no new output for 120 seconds:**

1. Check if the process is still alive (check background task status)
2. Check for active network connections to the API provider
3. If process is alive with active connection — continue waiting (possible network buffering)
4. If process is alive with NO active connection — the connection may have dropped. Report to user.
5. Do NOT kill the process without user confirmation

**If the pipeline was launched without streaming** (fallback mode), no heartbeats will appear. In this case, use process and network checks as the only liveness signal. There is no safe timeout value — thinking models take as long as they need.

### Background Health Checks

While waiting for LLM responses during DECOMPOSE or DISPATCH:

- Verify TypeScript still compiles: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- Verify tests still pass: `npm test`
- Check git status for uncommitted work
- Review the log file for warnings or errors that occurred in earlier stages

This turns dead time into useful verification rather than idle waiting.

### Failure Response

When a pipeline stage fails:

1. Report which stage failed and the error message
2. Check the log file for the full error context
3. Fix the code that caused the failure
4. Retry the pipeline from the beginning (stages are not independently restartable yet — that's a future milestone)
5. Do NOT perform the failed stage's work manually — see Anti-Pattern: Manual Analysis Bypass

### What This Replaces

Previous sessions used synchronous blocking: run the pipeline, wait silently, report everything at the end. This caused:

- No visibility during 2-5 minute LLM calls
- Stalls going undetected until the user checked back
- No diagnostic context when failures occurred deep in the pipeline
- Wasted time during LLM waits that could have been used for health checks
