# Codex Signum — Core Library

## For Claude Code (and any coding agent)

This is the core library for the Codex Signum protocol — a semantic encoding where **state is structural**. Consumer applications (like DND-Manager) import from this package. This repo is the single source of truth for all grammar-level infrastructure.

## Non-Negotiable Rules

### 1. This is a LIBRARY, not an application

Core is substrate-agnostic. It does NOT know about:
- DND-Manager, D&D, character sheets
- Specific LLM providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral, Google)
- Specific databases beyond abstract graph interfaces
- Any consumer application's business logic

If you find yourself importing from a consumer app — **STOP. You are going the wrong direction.**

### 2. dist/ is committed. There is NO prepare script.

```bash
npm run build       # Compiles to dist/
git add dist/       # ALWAYS commit dist/ after building
git commit          # Consumers install from GitHub and use committed dist/
```

**DO NOT** add a `prepare` script to package.json. npm runs `prepare` automatically when a consumer installs a GitHub dependency, which would rebuild dist/ from source during install and overwrite the committed files. This bug cost hours to diagnose. See commit `4cd0ecc`.

### 3. State Is Structural

The graph is the single source of truth. Do NOT create:
- Separate health databases or JSON caches
- SQLite tables for monitoring data
- Log files as state stores
- Any parallel state outside the graph

### 4. ΦL Is ALWAYS a Composite

ΦL is never `health: number`. It is always a structured object with raw factors, weights, maturity_factor, and effective score. If you see a bare number being passed as health, it's wrong.

### 5. Dampening Is NEVER Fixed

`γ = 0.7` everywhere is WRONG. Always compute from topology:
```
γ_effective = min(0.7, 0.8 / (k - 1))    for k > 1
```
Hub dampening uses `γ_base / √k` (NOT `γ_base / degree`).

### 6. Hysteresis = 2.5×

Recovery is 2.5× slower than degradation. Not 1.5×. This was corrected by research validation.

### 7. Cascade Limit = 2

Degradation propagates at most 2 containment levels. This is the primary safety mechanism. Never increase without a foundational amendment.

### 8. Signal Pipeline Is Complete — Don't Modify

The 7-stage signal conditioning pipeline in `src/computation/signals/` was built across 15 carefully audited commits, verified against Engineering Bridge §Part 4. Do not modify it unless fixing a specific documented bug.

### 9. .js Extensions on ALL Relative Imports

Every relative import MUST use `.js` extension:
```typescript
// CORRECT
import { computePhiL } from "./phi-l.js";

// WRONG — will fail at runtime
import { computePhiL } from "./phi-l";
```

### 10. Commit + Push After Every Task

Every discrete task produces a commit with a descriptive message and pushes to remote. Never accumulate uncommitted work across tasks.

## Files That DO NOT EXIST — Never Reference These

- ~~`src/health/`~~ → Health computation is in `src/computation/`
- ~~`src/agent/`~~ → There is no agent directory, patterns are in `src/patterns/`
- ~~`src/config/`~~ → No config directory
- ~~`src/utils/firebase.ts`~~ → Firebase does not exist in this project
- ~~`src/monitoring/`~~ → Monitoring is structural, not separate
- ~~`src/services/`~~ → No services directory
- ~~`core/` at repo root~~ → Source is in `src/`, not `core/`

If you need to find where something lives:
```bash
find src -name "*.ts" -type f | sort
grep -rn "export.*functionName" src/ --include="*.ts"
```

---

## Build & Verification

```bash
# Type check (run after every edit)
npx tsc --noEmit

# Run tests
npm test

# Build (ALWAYS do before committing)
npm run build

# Commit dist (ALWAYS after build)
git add dist/
git commit -m "build: description"

# Verify barrel exports
node -e "const c = require('./dist'); console.log(Object.keys(c).length, 'exports')"
```

---

## What NOT to Change

- **Morphemes, axioms, grammar rules** — these are immutable (v3.0 §Semantic Stability)
- **Signal conditioning pipeline** — 15 audited commits, verified against spec
- **Graph schema** — stable, extend only if adding new node types
- **Existing test expectations** — unless a fix changes behavior to match spec
- **package.json `prepare` script** — DO NOT ADD ONE (see rule #2)

---

## Test Governance

### Test Levels

| Level | Name | Scope | Location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Unit | Single function, deterministic, pure computation | `tests/conformance/` |
| 2 | Contract | Module API shape, type safety, export completeness | `tests/conformance/` |
| 3 | Pipeline | Multi-stage sequential flow, data propagation | `tests/pipeline/` |
| 4 | Outcome | End-to-end behavioral correctness with realistic inputs | `tests/conformance/` |
| 5 | Safety | Invariants that must never be violated, spec-encoded | `tests/safety/` |

Level 5 tests encode what the **spec requires**, not what the code currently does. If the implementation is wrong, safety tests FAIL — this is correct behavior. Tests-before-fix is the right order.

### Safety Invariants (Level 5)

| Invariant | Test File | Spec Source |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subcriticality: γ_effective ≤ 0.7 for all degree ≥ 1 | `tests/safety/subcriticality.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Cascade limit: propagation stops at depth 2 | `tests/safety/cascade-limit.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Hysteresis: recovery rate = degradation rate / 2.5 | `tests/safety/hysteresis.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |
| Algedonic bypass: ΦL < 0.1 forces γ = 1.0 | `tests/safety/algedonic-bypass.test.ts` | Engineering Bridge §Part 3 |

### Codex Conformance Coverage

Conformance tests (`tests/conformance/`) must cover these Codex dimensions:

- **State dimensions**: ΦL composite structure (never bare number), ΨH relational computation, εR spectral calibration
- **Morphemes**: Seed, Line, Bloom, Resonator, Grid, Helix — type shape and axiom compliance
- **Adaptive thresholds**: Young/Maturing/Mature bands with smooth interpolation
- **Signal pipeline**: All 7 stages spec-compliant (Debounce → Hampel → EWMA → CUSUM → MACD → Hysteresis → Trend)
- **Memory operations**: Exponential decay compaction (not fixed window), distillation, flow
- **Constitutional engine**: Rule evaluation, cascade prevention, amendment taxonomy
- **Resilience**: Circuit breaker with exponential backoff + jitter (not fixed cooldown)
- **Patterns**: Architect 7-stage pipeline, dev-agent pipeline, Thompson router

### Data Provenance Rule

All numbers cited in documentation, comments, code, or reports MUST:

- Cite their source (spec section, test output, or system measurement)
- Be marked `[estimated]` if produced by approximation rather than system output
- Never be presented as system output if they were estimated by inspection

### Pipeline Test Coverage Gate

The pre-commit gate warns (not blocks) if `src/signals/` was modified but `tests/pipeline/` has no `*.test.ts` files.

## Anti-Patterns This Repo Has Encountered

These are real bugs that have occurred in past sessions. Hooks exist to catch them.

| Anti-Pattern | What Went Wrong | Prevention |
|---|---|---|
| Fixed dampening γ=0.7 | Supercritical for branching factor ≥ 2 | Always compute γ_effective from topology |
| Fixed circuit breaker cooldown | Spec requires exponential backoff + jitter | Use `computeCooldown(tripCount, config)` |
| ModelExecutor name collision | Both dev-agent and architect exported same name | dev-agent uses `DevAgentModelExecutor` |
| `prepare` script in package.json | Rebuilt dist/ during consumer `npm install` | Removed in `4cd0ecc`, never re-add |
| Averaging children's ΨH | ΨH is relational — compute from subgraph λ₂ | `aggregateHealth` computes ΨH from graph |
| Static retention window for compaction | Spec uses continuous exponential decay | `weight = e^(-λ × age)`, not fixed window |
| Hysteresis ratio 1.5× | Below Schmitt trigger engineering standards | Corrected to 2.5× per research validation |
| Bare `number` as health score | ΦL must always be composite structure | Use `PhiLOutput` type, never bare number |
